            <p style={{marginLeft:'1em'}}>
              ANPR, which stands for Automatic Number Plate Recognition, is an advanced technology used to automatically capture and read vehicle number plates. Also known as License Plate Recognition (LPR) or License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, Smart Gate and ANPR uses specialized cameras and software to capture images of vehicle license plates and convert them into machine-readable text.

          <div className='Overview-paragraph2'>
            <p>
              The ANPR system operates by analyzing the captured images of license plates and extracting the alphanumeric characters from them. The smart gate utilizes various automated features and connectivity capabilities to enhance security, convenience, and control. Smart gates are commonly used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings, offering a modern and efficient alternative to traditional gates.
